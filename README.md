# Final-Project

Hi this is my final project for CIS 1051!

My project generates stock graphs to help users make better financial decisions.

I enjoyed learning all the new built in functions that are present with in my project. At first it was difficult to learn these functions so we first played around with these functions
in a prototype file. I then organized what I learned to make my final product. The most difficult part of the entire project was to learn the syntax for these newly discovered functions 
Learning these functions took time but in the end I believe my newly garnerd knowledge will allow me to bring a competitive advantage to the workplace. I am really happy how my project
turned out. Thank you for viewing my code,


Best
